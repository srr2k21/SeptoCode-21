Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its opposite rows and opposite columns.
   For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:
   1 2 3
   7 5 6 
   9 8 9
   The sum of the rows = 1+2+3+9+8+9= 32. The sum of the columns = 1+7+9+3+6+9= 35. Their absolute difference is |32-35|=3.
   
   Output:-
   int: the absolute difference
   
   Input Format:-
  - The first line consists t number of test cases
  - The second line contains a single integer, n, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix arr.
   Each of the next n lines describes a row, arr[i], and consists of n space-separated integers arr[i][j].
   
   Constraints:-
   - 1<=t<=45
   - 1 <= n <= 4
   - -100<=arr[i][j]<=100
   
   Sample Input:-
   1
   3
   11 2 4
   8 5 6 
   10 8 -12
   
   Sample Output:-
   4
   
   Explanation:-
   Sum across the rows = 11+2+4+10+8-12=23
   Sum across the columns = 11+8+10+4+6-12=27
   Absolute difference = |23-27|=4
