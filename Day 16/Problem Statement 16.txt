Mirsha is a computer science student in her final year. During a certain event, she was faced with an interesting problem.
Given a list of numbers, all except one numbers follows a certain odd-even pattern. Basically this means, from the list, 1 number will be odd, and rest even, or vice versa. Your task is to find the index of the number which doesn't follow the pattern.
The indexing here starts from 1.

Input Format:
t: Number of test cases
Next t lines follow, each having
n: length of the array
arr: input array, with each number separated by a space

Output Format:
int: just the index of the number

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 10
3 <= n <= 100
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

E.g.
Input:

2
5
5 7 2 11 99
4
8 91 144 2

Output:
3
2

Explanation:
i- In this first example, all are odd numbers except 2, hence index of 2 -> 3, is given as output
ii - In the second example, all numbers are even except 91, hence index of 91 -> 2, is given as output.
