Given a number of balls placed on top of each other in an order. It is kept in such a way that the number of balls goes on increasing in a column and then decreasing which resembles a mountain pattern.Jonita has been asked by her teacher to find whether the mountain has steep slope or gentle slope. Help Jonita solving out this problem.

Input variables:-
  int t=> no. of test cases
  int n=> length of the array
  int arr[]=>array containing no. of balls in each column
        
Input Description:-
 -First line of input consists of t,the number of test cases
 -Next each lines consist of n, length of the array
 -Next line consists of the array containing the number of balls in each column
            
Output Description:-
  Print whether the mountain formed has a steep slope or gentle slope

Constraints:-
 -> 1<=t,n<=10
 ->1<= no. of balls in each column <=10
                    
Sample Input:-
2
8
0 2 3 4 5 2 1 0
9
0 2 3 3 5 4 2 1 0

Sample Output:-
Steep
Gentle

Explanation:
In the first case, the slope goes on increasing till the peak, and then decreases, at every point of the array. Hence it is a steep slope.
In the second case, the slope goes on increasing, but at the 3rd element, it becomes same as the 4th element and then continues increasing, hence it's a gentle slope.
