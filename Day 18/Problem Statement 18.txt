A number of balls are kept in a basket each named in the range [1,n]. some students picked few balls randomly and changed their numbers to existing numbers in the box and then added back. Now box has unique numbers + duplicate numbers. Find the original numbers on the balls whose numbers were changed.
    
Input variables:-
   int t: no. of test cases
   int n: range 
   int arr[]: array conatining the original and duplicate numbered balls
        
Input Description:
-First line of input consists of t, the number of test cases
-Next each lines consist of n the range 
-Next line consist of the array conatining the original and duplicate numbered balls

Output Description:-
   Print the balls whose numbers were changed
    
Constraints:-
 -> 1<=t,n<=10
 ->1<= value of each array element <=10
    
 Sample Input:
2
8
4 3 2 7 8 2 3 1
2
1 1
    
Sample Output:
5 6
2


Explanation:
In the first case, length of array is 8
1 2 3 4 are present, but 5 and 6 are missing, and then 7 and 8 are present. So the original missing numbers are 5 and 6.

In the second case, length of array is 2, 1 is present, but 2 is missing. So missing number is 2.
