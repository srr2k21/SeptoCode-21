There are n marbles in a row. A child has to divide the marbles in halves untill he gets one marble. Find the minimum number of steps required to get the single marble. The halves can be unequal for odd numbers. After a division from odd even pair the child has to choose the even pair for futher division if the odd number is not 1.

Input variables:-
int t: no of test cases
int n: no of marbles

Output Description:
Print the number of minimum steps required to didvide the marbles into half untill one marble is left

Constraints:
1<=t<=100
1<=n<=1024

Sample input:
2
9
8

Sample Output:
3
3

Explaination:
9 can be divided into two halves first that is 4 and 5 then 4 can be divided into 2 and 2 in second step and then in the third step 2 can be divided into 1 and 1

8 can be divided into two halves first that is 4 and 4 then 4 can be divided into 2 and 2 in second step and then in the third step 2 can be divided into 1 and 1
